# ESP8266_Test_Range
Made by @ElectricalThinking29

# Description
+ This project is made to program two ESP8266 boards to communicate using 3 different protocol: TCP, UDP and ESP-NOW.
+ The purpose is to define which protocol will help ESP8266 communicate furthest and how far is that distance.
+ This project is made from PlatformIO on VS Code

# How to use
+ First, you need two board ESP8266 and configure your IDE (Arduino IDE or PlatformIO) to be able to program. You can consult the configuration for ESP8266 12-E if you are using PlatformIO [here](platformio.ini)
+ Second, you need to decide which board will be [the sender](ESP8266_Sender) and which is [the receiver](ESP8266_Receiver). In each folders, you will find 3 programs corresponding to 3 protocols, use it wisely.

# Results
+ I conducted this experiment outdoors. The results can be summarized as follows:
```
|_Protocol_|_Communicated distance_|
|   TCP    |          24 m         |
|   UDP    |          17 m         |
|  ESP-NOW |          60 m         |
```
> **Note**
> + I used the ESP8266 without any additional signal support devices (like antennas).
> + Because I use visualization to judge whether the packet transmission is successful or failed (when I wait for the LED light for too long, I consider it failed), so the distance values mentioned above are not 100% accurate.
