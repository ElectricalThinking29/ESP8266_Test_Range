# ESP8266_Test_Range
Made by @ElectricalThinking29

# Description
+ This project is made to program two ESP8266 boards to communicate using 3 different protocol: TCP, UDP and ESP-NOW.
+ The purpose is to define which protocol will help ESP8266 communicate furthest and how far is that distance.
+ This project is made from PlatformIO on VS Code

# How to use
+ First, you need two board ESP8266 and configure your IDE (Arduino IDE or PlatformIO) to be able to program. You can consult the configuration for ESP8266 12-E if you are using PlatformIO [here](platformio.ini)
+ Second, you need to decide which board will be [the sender](ESP8266_Sender) and which is [the receiver](ESP8266_Receiver). In each folders, you will find 3 programs corresponding to 3 protocols, use it wisely.

# Results and Reviews
+ Below is the result's data.
![Result2](result.jpg)
+ As you can see, the error is pretty large, from few to over 100 %. If we ignore the case
where the transmission's velocity is negative, the error is still go up to 50 %.
+ There are a number of issues that I think will improve measurement results:
  * Using more appropriate hardwares for measuring Time of Flight (ToF) of the message via WIfi
  * Using CSI data to get better timming
  * Improving the programs for better and faster reading
+ Even though I did this project just for fun and to satisfy my curiosity, I also don't mind listening
to your comments. If you want to ask questions, you can contact me at the address below.
